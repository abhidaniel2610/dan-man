	 <p><h4>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the largest of the terrestrial planets. The Earth is the only planet in our solar system not to be named after a Greek or Roman deity. The Earth was formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago and is the only known planet to support life.</h4></p>

			<h3><li>The Earth’s rotation is gradually slowing.</h3></li>
			<h4><p>This deceleration is happening almost imperceptibly, at approximately 17 milliseconds per hundred years, although the rate at which it occurs is not perfectly uniform. This has the effect of lengthening our days, but it happens so slowly that it could be as much as 140 million years before the length of a day will have increased to 25 hours.</h4></p>
			<h3><li>The Earth was once believed to be the centre of the universe.</h3></li>
			<h4><p>Due to the apparent movements of the Sun and planets in relation to their viewpoint, ancient scientists insisted that the Earth remained static, whilst other celestial bodies travelled in circular orbits around it. Eventually, the view that the Sun was at the centre of the universe was postulated by Copernicus, though this is also not the case</h4></p>
			<h3><li>Earth has a powerful magnetic field.</h3></li>
			<h4><p>This phenomenon is caused by the nickel-iron core of the planet, coupled with its rapid rotation. This field protects the Earth from the effects of solar wind.</h4></p>
			<h3><li>There is only one natural satellite of the planet Earth.</h3></li>
			<h4><p>As a percentage of the size of the body it orbits, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon">Moon</a> is the largest satellite of any planet in our solar system. In real terms, however, it is only the fifth largest natural satellite.</h4></p>
			<h3><li>Earth is the only planet not named after a god.</h3></li>
			<h4><p>The other seven planets in our solar system are all named after Roman gods or goddesses. Although only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)">Mercury,</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_(planet)">Venus,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_(planet)">Mars,</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(planet)"> Jupiter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(planet)">Saturn</a> were named during ancient times, because they were visible to the naked eye, the Roman method of naming planets was retained after the discovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus_(planet)">Uranus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_(planet)">Neptune.</a></h4></p>
			<h3><li>The Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System.</h3></li>
			<h4><p>This varies according to the part of the planet; for example, the metallic core is denser than the crust. The average density of the Earth is approximately 5.52 grams per cubic centimetre.</h4></p>

		<p><h2><ins>Some few more facts about earth</ins></p></h2>
		<p><h4>-Earth is mostly iron, oxygen and silicon<br></h4>If you could separate the Earth out into piles of material, you’d get 32.1 % iron, 30.1% oxygen, 15.1% silicon, and 13.9% magnesium. Of course, most of this iron is actually down at the core of the Earth. If you could actually get down and sample the core, it would be 88% iron. 47% of the Earth’s crust consists of oxygen.</p>
		<p><h4>-Earth doesn’t take 24 hours to rotate on its axis<br></h4>It’s actually 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds. This is the amount of time it takes for the Earth to completely rotate around its axis; astronomers call this a sidereal day. Now wait a second, that means a day is 4 minutes shorter than we think it is. You’d think that time would add up, day by day, and within a few months, day would be night, and night would be day.</p>
		<p><h4>-A year on Earth isn’t 365 days</h4>It’s actually 365.2564 days. It’s this extra .2564 days that creates the need for leap years. That’s why we tack on an extra day in February every year divisible by 4 – 2004, 2008, etc – unless it’s divisible by 100 (1900, 2100, etc)… unless it’s divisible by 400 (1600, 2000, etc).</p>
		
		<p><h3><ins>BONUS FACTS:</ins></h3></p>
		<p>-Only 3% water of the earth is fresh, rest 97% salted. Of that 3%, over 2% is frozen in ice sheets and glaciers. Means less than 1% fresh water is found in lakes, rivers and underground.</p>
		<p>-Each winter there are about 1 septillion (1, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000 or a trillion trillion) snow crystals that drop from the sky.</p>
